    <h1>About Me:</h1>
    <hr/>
    <p>My Name is Tobias, i just moved to a different City, always loved tech stuff like buidling Computers myself and setting them up.
        Absolutely love Cars and also working on them. I'm a way to competetive Person, because if i see someone doing something better than me
        i try so hard until i'm able to do it better and faster - Probably a Redflag as a Human beeing. Even tho i always wanted to learn to code 
        i first had to find my Way of learning things, because of my ADHD in combination with Autism, i often get distracted which means i need to be
        full on in on what i want to do, like a perma Hyperfocus. I'm currently 28 Years old going for the 29th Birthday this year and trying so hard at the moment
        with building a better future for myself and probably some Wife and Kids someday. :)
